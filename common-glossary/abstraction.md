# Abstraction

In software engineering and computer science, abstraction is:

- the process of removing physical, spatial, or temporal details or attributes in the study of objects or systems to focus attention on details of greater importance
- the creation of abstract concept-objects by mirroring common features or attributes of various non-abstract objects or systems of study â€“ the result of the process of abstraction.

Abstraction, in general, is a fundamental concept in computer science and software development. The process of abstraction can also be referred to as **modeling** and is closely related to the concepts of theory and design. **Models** can also be considered types of abstractions per their generalization of aspects of reality.

# Pointer

A pointer is a variable that stores a memory address.  Pointers are used to store the addresses of other variables or memory items.  Pointers are very useful for another type of parameter passing, usually referred to as [pass by reference](./pass-by-reference.md).  Pointers are essential for dynamic memory allocation.

# Declarative Programming

**Declarative programming** is a programming paradigm that allows the developer to define what the program should accomplish rather than explicitly defining how it should go about doing so. This approach lends itself naturally to the programmatic definition of formal logic systems, and has the benefit of simplifying the programming of some parallel processing applications.

The main goal of declarative programming is to abstract away complex control flows for logic. Declarative programming relies on underlying components of a given language to carry out the necessary steps to reach the stated outcome. In declarative programming, typical programming constructs such as loops and if/then conditions do not exist, because they are instructional.

# Procedural Programming

**Procedural programming** is a [programming paradigm](./programming-paradigm.md), derived from [imperative programming](./imperative-programming) based on the concept of the *procedure call*. Procedures (a type of routine or subroutine) simply contain a series of computational steps to be carried out. Any given procedure might be called at any point during a program's execution, including by other procedures or itself.

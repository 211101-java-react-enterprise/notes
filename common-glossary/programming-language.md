# Programming Language

A **programming language** is a formal language comprising a set of strings that produce various kinds of actions taken by some hardware. Programming languages are one kind of computer language, and are used in computer programming to implement algorithms. **Programming** simply means the ability to translate into language understandable by the computer, whatever we wish to have accomplished by the computer.

## High-Level and Low-Level Programming Languages

In computer science, a **high-level programming language** is a programming language with strong [abstraction](./abstraction.md) from the details of the computer. Languages of this nature may use natural language elements, be easier to use, or may automate (or even hide entirely) significant areas of computing systems (e.g. memory management), making the process of developing a program simpler and more understandable. The amount of abstraction provided defines how "high-level" a programming language is. Examples of high-level programming languages include: C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, and C#.

A **low-level programming language** is a programming language that provides little or no abstraction from a computer's instruction set architecture â€” commands or functions in the language map that are structurally similar to processor's instructions. Generally, this refers to either [machine code](./machine-language.md) or [assembly language](./assembly-language.md). Because of the low (hence the word) abstraction between the language and machine language, low-level languages are sometimes described as being *"close to the hardware"*. Programs written in low-level languages tend to be relatively non-portable, due to being optimized for a certain type of system architecture.

# Virtual Machine

In computing, a **virtual machine (VM)** is the virtualization/emulation of a computer system. Virtual machines are based on computer architectures and provide functionality of a physical computer. Their implementations may involve specialized hardware, software, or a combination of both.

Virtual machines differ and are organized by their function, shown here:

- **System virtual machines** (also termed full virtualization VMs) provide a substitute for a real machine. They provide functionality needed to execute entire operating systems. A **hypervisor** uses native execution to share and manage hardware, allowing for multiple environments which are isolated from one another, yet exist on the same physical machine. Modern hypervisors use hardware-assisted virtualization, virtualization-specific hardware, primarily from the host CPUs.

- **Process virtual machines** are designed to execute computer programs in a platform-independent environment (e.g. the Java Virtual Machine, .NET's Common Language Runtime)

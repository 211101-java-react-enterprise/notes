# Assembly Language

**Assembly language**, sometimes abbreviated **asm**, is any low-level [programming language](./programming-language.md) in which there is a very strong correspondence between the instructions in the language and the architecture's [machine code instructions](./machine-language.md). Because assembly depends on the machine code instructions, every assembly language is designed for exactly one specific computer architecture. For instance, the set of instructions supported by x86 processors looks very different from the set of instructions supported by ARM processors.

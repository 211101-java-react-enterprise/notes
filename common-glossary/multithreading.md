# Multithreading

**Multithreading** is the ability for a piece of software to manage and execute multiple [threads](./thread.md) either c[concurrently](./concurrency.md) or [in parallel](./parallelism.md) at [runtime](./runtime-environment.md). This ability necessitates the ability for the software to invoke threads at an [operating system](./operating-system.md) level.

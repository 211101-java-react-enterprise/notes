# Imperative Programming

Imperative programming is a software development paradigm where functions are implicitly coded in every step required to solve a problem. In imperative programming, every operation is coded and the code itself specifies how the problem is to be solved, which means that pre-coded models are not called on.

Imperative programming requires an understanding of the functions necessary to solve a problem, rather than a reliance on models that are able to solve it. The focus of imperative programming is how the problem should be solved, which requires a detailed step-by-step guide. Because the written code performs the functions instead of models, the programmer must code each step. [Procedural](./procedural-programming.md) and [object-oriented programming (OOP)](./object-oriented-programming.md) languages fall under imperative programming, such as C, C++, C#, and Java.

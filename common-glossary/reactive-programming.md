# Reactive Programming

**Reactive programming** (also referred to as **Functional Reactive Programming, or FRP**) describes a design paradigm that relies on asynchronous programming logic to handle real-time updates to otherwise static content  by integrating time flow and compositional events into the [functional programming](./functional-programming.md) paradigm. It provides an efficient means -- the use of automated data streams -- to handle data updates to content whenever a user makes an inquiry. This provides an elegant way to express computation in domains such as interactive animations, robotics, computer vision, user interfaces, and simulation.

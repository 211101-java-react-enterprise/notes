# Integrated Development Environment

An **integrated development environment (IDE)** is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists of at least a source code editor, [build](./build.md) automation tools, and a debugger. Some IDEs contain the necessary compiler, interpreter, or both; while others do not.

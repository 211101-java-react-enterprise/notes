# Machine Language

In computer programming, **machine language** (or **machine code**) is a [low-level programming language](./programming-language.md#high-level-and-low-level-programming-languages), consisting of machine language instructions, used to control a computer's central processing unit (CPU). Each instruction causes the CPU to perform a very specific task, such as a load, a store, a jump, or an arithmetic logic unit (ALU) operation on one or more units of data in the CPU's registers or memory.

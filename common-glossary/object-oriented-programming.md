# Object-Oriented Programming

Object-oriented programming (**OOP**) is a subparadigm belonging to the [imperative programming paradigm](./imperative-paradigm.md)), and is based on the concept of "objects". Objects are instances of type definitions, or *classes*, that can contain **state** and **behavior**: state in the form of *fields* (also known as *attributes* or *properties*), and behavior, in the form of *procedures* (also known as *methods*).

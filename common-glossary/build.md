# Build

In a programming context, a **build** is a version of a program. As a rule, a build is a pre-release version and as such is identified by a build number, rather than by a release number. Reiterative (repeated) builds are an important part of the development process. Throughout development, application components are collected and repeatedly compiled for testing purposes, to ensure a reliable final product. Build tools - such as [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/, [Ant](https://ant.apache.org/), [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/), and [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) - enable developers to automate some programming tasks that relate to the [compilation](./compilation.md), testing, and packaging of the application.

As a verb, "to build" can mean either to write code or to put individual coded components of a program together to prepare it for execution.

# Compiler

A compiler is a special program that processes statements written in a particular [programming language](./programming-language.md) and turns them into another language that is at a lower level of abstraction (e.g. [bytecode](./bytecode.md), assembly, or machine language). Typically, a programmer writes language statements in a language such as Pascal or C one line at a time using an editor. The file that is created contains what are called the source statements. The programmer then runs the appropriate language compiler, specifying the name of the file that contains the source statements.

# Compiled Language

Compiled languages are converted directly into machine code that the processor can execute. As a result, they tend to be faster and more efficient to execute than [interpreted languages](./interpreted-language.md). They also give the developer more control over hardware aspects, like memory management and CPU usage. Compiled languages need a [build](./build.md) step â€“ they need to be manually compiled first. You need to rebuild the program every time you need to make a change.

Examples of pure compiled languages are C, C++, Erlang, Haskell, Rust, and Go.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

**Advantages of compiled languages***
- Programs that are compiled into native machine code tend to be faster than interpreted code. This is because the process of translating code at run time adds to the overhead, and can cause the program to be slower overall.

**Disadvantages of compiled languages**
- Additional time needed to complete the entire compilation step before testing
- Platform dependence of the generated binary code

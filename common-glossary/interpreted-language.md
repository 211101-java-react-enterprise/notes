# Interpreted Language
 
An **interpreted language** is a type of [programming language](./programming-language.md) for which most of its implementations execute instructions directly and freely, without previously compiling a program into machine-language instructions. The interpreter executes the program directly, translating each statement into a sequence of one or more subroutines, and then into another language (often [machine code](./machine-language.md)).

The terms interpreted language and [compiled language](./compiled-language.md) are not well defined because, in theory, any programming language can be either interpreted or compiled. In modern programming language implementation, it is increasingly popular for a platform to provide both options - with Java being an example of a language that is both compiled and interpreted.

Interpreted languages can also be contrasted with machine languages. Functionally, both *execution* and *interpretation* mean the same thing â€” fetching the next instruction/statement from the program and executing it. Although interpreted [bytecode](./bytecode.md) is additionally identical to machine code in form and has an assembler representation, the term "interpreted" is sometimes reserved for "software processed" languages (by [virtual machine](./virtual-machine.md) or emulator) on top of the native (i.e. hardware) processor.

# Domain Specific Language

A **Domain Specific Language (DSL)** is a programming language with a higher level of abstraction optimized for a specific class of problems. A DSL uses the concepts and rules from the field or domain. DSLs usually less complex than a general-purpose language, such as Java, C, or Ruby. Generally, DSLs are developed in close coordination with the experts in the field for which the DSL is being designed. In many cases, DSLs are intended to be used not by software people, but instead by non-programmers who are fluent in the domain the DSL addresses.

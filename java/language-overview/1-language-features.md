# Java Language Features

Java is an [object-oriented](../../common-glossary/object-oriented-programming.md) programming language developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995 (Sun Microsystems was later acquired by Oracle in 2010). It is a [general-purpose](../../common-glossary/general-purpose-language.md) programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (**WORA**), meaning that [compiled](../../common-glossary/compilation.md) Java code can run on all [platforms](../../common-glossary/development-platform.md) that support Java without the need for recompilation.

As an object-oriented language, Java has obvious support for [imperative] (../../common-glossary/imperative-paradigm.md) syntax and styles of programming. In modern versions of the Java language support [declarative](../../common-glossary/declarative-paradigm.md)) syntax has been added to offer more flexibility in the way that developers can write their systems.

# Java Language Features

Java is an object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995 (Sun Microsystems were later acquired by Oracle in 2010). It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (**WORA**), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.
